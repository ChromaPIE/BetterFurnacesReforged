Resume

This mod project plans to rewrite the old Better Furnaces
mod for the new versions, adapting it to the new Minecraft concepts, but without leaving its
old look.

Objective and Thanks

I have no financial interests in this, the fun and knowledge acquired to do it are the most important.  Parts of code from other open source mods were used for certain elements.  
The Iron Furnaces mod code base was completely used to make this version
